By constructing a page graph\nthat captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM\nperforms graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with\nlogical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and\nlogical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the\ntop-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance\nflexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy\ndeployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.\nExperiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in\naccuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over\nbaselines.

It is therefore beneficial\nto develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training\ninstances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,\nwith RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for\nRE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a\nmulti-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively\ncapture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,\nalthough employing binary classification for each relation individually can\nmitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,\nresulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training\ninstances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the\nadvantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,\nRelation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its\nsuperior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled\ntexts for RE."}
