TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大语言模型在语音基础的失智症检测中的适配策略，发现适当的示例选择、推理增强和微调策略可显著提高检测性能，开源模型经适配后可与商业系统相当或更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国过半数阿尔茫海默病患者未被诊断，语音基础的筛查方案具有可扩展性。需要研究大语言模型的适配策略在失智症检测中的效果。

Method: 使用DementiaBank语音语料库，评估了9个纯文本模型和3个多模态音频-文本模型。测试了上下文学习、推理增强提示、参数高效微调和多模态整合等适配策略。

Result: 类质心示例获得最高上下文学习性能，推理提升了小模型表现，切片级微调效果最佳。添加分类头显著改善了表现较差的模型。多模态模型表现良好但未超越最佳纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适配策略（包括示例选择、推理设计和调整方法）对语音基础的失智症检测至关重要，经适当适配的开源模型可以达到或超过商业系统的性能。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA)框架，通过自合成数据和强化学习来提升语音大语言模型在指令跟随任务中的性能，超越了传统蒸馏方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型(SpeechLMs)由于模态差异，在指令跟随任务中相比文本大语言模型存在显著性能差距，特别是在处理动态多变的用户语音时。

Method: 采用自合成方法通过强大的教师LLM生成大量高质量对齐数据，然后使用基于强化学习的方法将SpeechLMs的行为与教师模型对齐，避免依赖人工标注的监督微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升了SpeechLMs的指令跟随能力，超越了传统蒸馏基线，并在口语问答和语音转文本翻译等任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RBA框架能够仅使用自生成数据就显著提升SpeechLMs的性能，证明了其在多模态语言模型对齐中的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

### [3] [Multilevel Analysis of Cryptocurrency News using RAG Approach with Fine-Tuned Mistral Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03527)
*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用微调Mistral 7B大语言模型结合RAG技术进行加密货币新闻的多层次多任务分析，生成图结构和文本摘要，并通过层次堆叠整合为综合报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在加密货币新闻分析中的幻觉问题，提供互补的图结构和文本视角，实现更准确的多层次分析。

Method: 采用4-bit量化的PEFT/LoRA方法微调Mistral 7B模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)技术，首层生成带情感分数的图和文本摘要及JSON表示，高层进行层次堆叠整合。

Result: 微调后的Mistral 7B模型能够进行信息丰富的定性和定量分析，知识图谱表示有效消除了大语言模型的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为加密货币新闻分析提供了有效的多层次分析框架，结合图和文本摘要的互补优势，显著提升了分析质量和可靠性。

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ResearchPulse是一个基于代理的框架，用于多文档科学推理任务，通过提取和对齐相关论文中的动机、方法和实验结果来重建研究发展链


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解科学思想的演变需要超越单篇论文摘要，需要进行结构化、跨文档的主题相关研究推理

Method: 提出基于代理的框架ResearchPulse，包含三个协调代理：Plan Agent用于任务分解，Mmap-Agent构建动机-方法思维导图，Lchart-Agent合成实验折线图

Result: 实验表明，尽管使用7B规模的代理，该系统在语义对齐、结构一致性和视觉保真度方面始终优于GPT-4o等强基线

Conclusion: 该工作形式化了多文档科学推理任务，并提出了有效的解决方案和基准数据集，为科学文献分析提供了新工具

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ResearchPulse/ResearchPulse-Bench.

### [6] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多模态框架，通过将营收会议编码为层次话语树来生成语义丰富且结构意识的嵌入表示，充分利用文本、音频、视频和元数据来提升财务预测和话语分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的财务情感分析系统多依赖平面的文档级或句子级模型，无法抓取营收会议这类半结构化财务沟通的层次话语结构。

Method: 提出两段式Transformer架构：第一阶段通过对比学习在节点级利用文本、音频、视频情感信号以及语义元数据编码多模态内容；第二阶段合成整个会议的全局嵌入表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架生成的嵌入表示能够稳定地反映情感语调、结构逻辑和主题对齐，形成语义丰富的表征。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅在财务报告领域有应用价值，还可扩展到医疗电话、教育和政治话语等高风险非脚本化沟通领域，为多模态话语表征提供了稳健且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 早期识别青少年自杀意念的转换器模型，通过分析论坛帖子预测自杀意念行为，准确率达73%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难，应用社交媒体实时数据可及早发现风险

Method: 提出Early-SIB转换器模型，序列处理用户发布和互动的论坛帖子，预测是否会发布自杀意念内容

Result: 在荷兰青少年论坛上达到0.73的平衡准确率，能够在用户显式表达自杀意念前进行预测

Conclusion: 该方法为自杀预防提供了有效的新工具，可作为传统方法的补充

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

### [8] [Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531)
*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于网络搜索注释的实体级幻觉检测方法，通过线性探针训练的分类器在长文本生成中实现了高效的实时幻觉检测，性能超过现有基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗、法律等高风险应用中的幻觉问题可能造成严重害备，而现有检测方法要么限于短词条查询要么需要昂贵的外部验证，实际应用性低

Method: 开发了一种基于网络搜索的注释方法，对模型响应进行基于实体的标签化，标记哪些token对应虚构实体，然后使用简单高效的线性探针方法训练幻觉检测分类器

Result: 在四个模型家族上评估，该方法在长文本生成中持续超过基线方法（如AUC 0.90 vs 0.71），甚至在短形式问答中也有改善，而且虽然仅训练了实体级标签，但能够泛化到数学推理任务中的错误检测

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有前景的新方法，实现了可扩展、实时的幻觉检测，并公开释放了数据集以便重用，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [9] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出UDIB方法，通过信息瓶颈原理改进语义分歧检测，用计算高效的上界替代KL散度，为LLM幻觉检测提供更敏感的工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分歧检测方法基于空间聚类优化，而非信息理论分析，存在优化目标与下游任务不匹配的问题

Method: 基于确定性信息瓶颈(DIB)开发UDIB算法，用计算高效上界替代KL散度，实现熵正则化的鲁棒K-means聚类

Result: UDIB生成共享主题表示，不仅在空间上一致，而且在信息理论层面最大化提示-响应的关系信息

Conclusion: UDIB为语义分歧检测框架提供更优越的基础，是检测LLM幻觉的新型敏感工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational
resources, but the lack of practice materials tailored to these resources
presents a significant challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing
a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR²框架通过对抗性强化学习增强LLM的抽象推理能力，使用教师模型将核心问题转化为叙事丰富的挑战性描述，训练学生模型从中提取计算核心，显著提升模型在未见编程任务上的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM主要关注表面模式识别，缺乏对抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象能力是计算机科学的基础技能，对LLM泛化能力至关重要

Method: 提出AR²对抗性强化学习框架：教师模型将内核问题转化为叙事丰富的挑战性描述（不改变基本逻辑），学生编码模型训练从复杂叙事中提取底层计算内核

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在先前未见挑战性编程任务上的准确率

Conclusion: 抽象是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架有效提升了LLM的抽象推理能力

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过动态构建知识图来提升LLM的事实性回答能力，结合内部知识提取和外部知识检索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在事实性回答时的限制，尤其是参数化记忆的不足，以及传统RAG方法对非结构化文本的依赖导致组合推理能力不足

Method: 动态构建和扩展知识图：从问题中提取种子KG，通过LLM潜在知识迭代扩展，然后通过外部检索选择性精炼图谱

Result: 在三个事实QA测试集上均表现更优，在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面超过基线方法

Conclusion: 推理时知识图构建是提升LLM事实性的有前景方向，具有结构化、可解释性和可扩展性优势

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

*Weihao Wu,Liang Cao,Xinyu Wu,Zhiwei Lin,Rui Niu,Jingbei Li,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoxRole是首个专门用于评估语音角色扮演对话系统的综合基准，包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据，涵盖1228个电影角色，解决了该领域缺乏标准化评估基准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话系统研究存在两个主要局限：一是主要关注文本模态，忽略了语音中的副语言特征（语调、韵律、节奏等）；二是缺乏标准化的评估基准，现有语音对话数据集无法有效量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用大语言模型（LLM）系统地为每个角色构建多维度的角色档案，从而构建VoxRole基准数据集。

Result: 基于VoxRole基准对当代语音对话模型进行了多维度评估，揭示了这些模型在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演对话系统评估的关键空白，为未来研究提供了标准化的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

*Jiajun He,Naoki Sawada,Koichi Miyazaki,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO方法通过音素增强编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，显著提升了上下文ASR在特定领域命名实体识别上的性能，特别是在处理同音词和多词实体方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在处理领域特定命名实体（特别是同音词）时表现不佳，上下文ASR方法由于实体多样性有限而难以捕捉细粒度音素变化，且现有方法将实体视为独立标记导致多词实体偏置不完整。

Method: 提出PARCO方法，整合了音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤四个组件，增强音素区分能力，确保完整实体检索，并在不确定性下减少误报。

Result: 在1000个干扰项下，PARCO在中文AISHELL-1上达到4.22%的CER，在英文DATA2上达到11.14%的WER，显著优于基线方法，并在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上表现出稳健增益。

Conclusion: PARCO通过综合的音素增强和实体处理机制，有效解决了上下文ASR中的实体识别问题，特别是在处理同音词和多词实体方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过轻量级steering vectors在推理时减少LLM作为评估者时的自我偏好偏见，无需重新训练，可减少97%的不合理自我偏好偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估者时存在自我偏好偏见，倾向于偏爱自己的输出而非其他模型的输出，这影响了评估的公平性和可靠性

Method: 使用对比激活添加(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建steering vectors，并创建区分合理与不合理自我偏好的数据集

Result: steering vectors可将不合理自我偏好偏见减少高达97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法

Conclusion: steering vectors在减少不合理自我偏好偏见方面表现出色，但在合理自我偏好和无偏见一致性方面不稳定，表明需要更鲁棒的干预措施

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析MIMIC-IV数据库中SNOMED CT概念的共现模式和语义向量相似性，研究发现这两种方法具有互补性，能够提高临床注释完整性和发现潜在临床关联


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富的临床叙述但非结构化格式对大规模分析造成挑战，需要探索SNOMED CT标准术语之间的关联关系

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV数据库，采用标准化相互信息(NPMI)和预训练向量嵌入(ClinicalBERT、BioBERT)分析SNOMED CT概念的共现模式和语义相似性

Result: 共现和语义相似性呈弱相关关系，但向量嵌入能抓取临床意义关联；向量建议的概念经常与后期文档匹配；聚类结果显示了临床主题；共现模式与死亡率、再入院等结果相关

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义向量嵌入具有互补价值，能够提高文档完整性、发现潜在临床关联，并为决策支持和表型分析应用提供信息

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

Motivation: 解决跨目标和跨领域的立场检测问题，传统方法在新目标域中性能下降，需要能够从新域中有效学习的方法

Method: 使用度量学习和三元组损失来捕捉立场目标之间的语义相似性和差异，构建判别性嵌入空间，实现跨目标/跨领域的知识迁移

Result: 在两个数据集上的多个跨目标和跨域场景中评估，结果显示在六个广泛使用的立场检测模型上都取得了统计显著的性能提升

Conclusion: MLSD方法通过度量学习有效提升了跨域立场检测的性能，证明了该方法在少样本学习场景中的有效性

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SiLVERScore，一种基于语义感知嵌入的手语生成评估指标，直接在联合嵌入空间中评估手语，避免了传统回译方法的两步评估流程带来的模糊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手语生成评估采用回译方法（生成的手语先识别回文本，再用文本指标比较），这种方法无法捕捉手语的多模态特性（如面部表情、空间语法、韵律），且难以区分评估错误是来自生成模型还是翻译系统。

Method: 提出SiLVERScore指标，在联合嵌入空间中进行语义感知评估。该方法能够处理语义和韵律变化，并探索跨数据集的泛化挑战。

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore在正确对和随机对之间实现了近乎完美的区分（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率 < 7%），显著优于传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore提供了一个更准确、更直接的手语生成评估方法，能够更好地捕捉手语的多模态特性，解决了传统回译评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个四指标的评估套件，用于系统性评估大型视觉语言模型在交互式基础设置中的表现，发现当前模型在多个指标上都与人类存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的评测标准多为单轮或问答式设置，而基础设置是一个交互过程，需要通过持续沟通形成共享理解。

Method: 提出四指标套件（基础效率、内容对齐、词汇适应和人类相似度），在150个自我对战交互引用游戏中测试三个专有VLM模型，并与人类对比。

Result: 所有三个模型在至少三个指标上都与人类模式分异，GPT4o-mini整体最接近人类。任务成功分数不能表明成功基础，高图像-语句对齐度也不必然预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该指标套件和发现为未来VLM基础研究提供了框架，强调了交互式基础评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

TL;DR: 提出了Align-then-Slide评估框架，解决大语言模型文档级机器翻译中句子不对齐的评估难题，通过自动对齐和滑动窗口评估实现准确评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在文档级机器翻译中产生整文档输出，但现有评估方法假设句子级对齐，无法有效评估超长文档翻译质量。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) Align阶段自动推断源-目标句子对应关系并重建目标文本；2) n-Chunk滑动评估阶段计算多粒度平均指标分数。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名达到0.929皮尔逊相关性，在新构建的真实测试集上也与人工判断高度一致，并能有效支持CPO训练和GRPO奖励模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为文档级机器翻译系统提供了准确、鲁棒且可操作的评估工具，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

TL;DR: NE-PADD是一种新颖的部分音频深度伪造检测方法，通过利用命名实体知识，在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上超越了现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的句子级音频深度伪造检测(ADD)无法满足帧级定位需求，而现有的部分音频深度伪造检测(PADD)方法在利用音频语义信息（特别是命名实体）方面研究不足。

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和PADD，采用注意力融合(AF)和注意力转移(AT)两种注意力聚合机制，通过辅助损失利用命名实体语义指导PADD。

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 证明了在PADD中整合命名实体知识的有效性，为音频深度伪造检测提供了新的语义增强途径。

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Drivelology（废话学）这一独特语言现象，发现当前大语言模型虽然擅长NLP任务，但无法理解这种具有深度隐含意义的废话文本，揭示了LLMs在语用理解上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前大语言模型在处理具有深度隐含意义、语用矛盾或修辞颠覆性的特殊语言现象时的能力局限，挑战统计流畅性等同于认知理解的假设。

Method: 构建包含1200多个精心策划示例的多语言基准数据集，通过专家评审和多轮讨论验证样本质量，评估LLMs在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: LLMs经常混淆废话学与浅层无意义内容，产生不连贯的辩解，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能，显示出明显的理解局限性。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了LLMs在语用理解上的深层次表征差距，表明统计流畅性并不等同于认知理解，需要进一步研究超越表面连贯性的语言深度建模。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

Motivation: 尽管思维链推理技术提升了LLM在多项任务上的表现，但对其如何影响语言模型可信度的全面理解仍然不足，需要系统性的综述研究。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，按时间顺序对近期推理模型和CoT技术的研究进行结构化梳理，详细分析各研究方法、发现和局限性。

Result: 研究发现推理技术虽然通过减少幻觉、检测有害内容和提升鲁棒性来增强模型可信度，但最先进的推理模型本身在安全性、鲁棒性和隐私性方面存在可比甚至更严重的漏洞。

Conclusion: 本文为AI安全社区提供了关于推理可信度最新进展的宝贵资源，指出了未来研究方向，强调了在推进推理技术的同时需要关注其安全风险。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

Motivation: 大型语言模型可能遵循有害指令引发安全担忧，现有研究使用探测方法来检测恶意输入，但作者发现这些方法在分布外性能表现差，怀疑其学习的是表面模式而非语义有害性

Method: 通过控制实验系统验证假设：首先比较简单n-gram方法的性能，然后使用语义清理的数据集进行控制实验，最后详细分析模式依赖性

Result: 确认探测方法学习的是指令模式和触发词等表面模式，而非语义有害性，揭示了当前探测方法存在的局限性

Conclusion: 当前基于探测的方法存在虚假安全感，需要重新设计模型和评估协议，为负责任的安全研究方向提供建议

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Result: 在MobileRAG-Eval基准测试上进行了广泛实验，结果显示MobileRAG能够轻松处理现实世界移动任务，比现有最佳方法提升10.3%的性能，且使用更少的操作步骤。

Conclusion: MobileRAG框架通过RAG技术有效解决了当前移动代理的局限性，在复杂现实任务中表现出色，为移动自动化任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

TL;DR: KPoEM是一个韩国诗歌情感分析数据集，包含7,662条多标签情感注释，通过精调韩语模型在诗歌情感识别上得到显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在文本情感分类上取得了显著进步，但韩国诗歌因其比喻性语言和文化特异性而研究不足

Method: 构建包含7,662条目的多标签情感数据集（行级和作品级），注释44个细粒度情感类别，采用顺序精调方法先在通用语料上训练再在KPoEM数据集上精调

Result: 精调后的韩语模型显著超过以往模型，F1-micro得分0.60（通用语料训练模型仅0.34），能够识别时间和文化特定的情感表达

Conclusion: KPoEM数据集垩建了计算方法与文学分析之间的桥梁，为通过结构化数据定量探索诗歌情感提供了新可能性

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

TL;DR: SelfAug是一种自分布对齐方法，通过在检索增强生成(RAG)微调中保持模型语义分布来缓解灾难性遗忘问题，在保持通用能力的同时提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在RAG场景中虽然能提升任务特定性能，但会导致灾难性遗忘问题，使模型失去原有知识和通用能力。现有解决方案要么需要通用指令数据，要么在保持模型原始分布方面存在局限。

Method: 提出SelfAug自分布对齐方法，通过将输入序列logits对齐来保持模型的语义分布，从而缓解灾难性遗忘并改善下游性能。

Result: 大量实验表明SelfAug在下游学习和通用能力保持之间实现了优越的平衡。实证分析揭示了分布偏移与RAG场景中灾难性遗忘严重程度之间的直接相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅推进了对RAG背景下灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了一个适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/SelfAug.

*Yuhao Zhang,Shaoming Duan,Jinhang Su,Chuanyi Liu,Peiyi Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证驱动的迭代微调和错误驱动损失机制，解决了SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPIN方法在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性：无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 1. 自博弈前采用验证驱动的迭代微调方法，基于数据库模式和验证反馈迭代合成高质量微调数据；2. 自博弈微调阶段提出错误驱动损失方法，鼓励对手模型产生错误输出，使主模型能够区分正确和错误的SQL。

Result: 在6个开源LLM和5个广泛使用的基准测试上的实验表明，该方法优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL方法有效解决了SPIN在Text-to-SQL任务中的挑战，通过创新的验证驱动和错误驱动机制显著提升了SQL生成能力。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在中文谣言事实核查方面的有效性和局限性，尽管LLMs被广泛使用但其事实核查能力仍不确定

Method: 构建包含约2万个实例的标注数据集CANDY，使用思维链推理和少样本提示技术测试LLMs，开发分类法分析错误解释

Result: 当前LLMs在生成准确事实核查结论方面存在局限，事实捏造是最常见的失败模式，但作为人类辅助工具时能显著提升性能

Conclusion: LLMs单独用于事实核查不可靠，但在作为辅助工具部署时具有增强人类性能的巨大潜力

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低资源语言（如拉丁语）缺乏高质量标注数据，导致大语言模型在这些语言上性能差异，需要创建基础语料资源

Method: 利用少量并行拉丁-意大利语句对，通过翻译单语意大利语数据生成合成数据集，并采用严格过滤咄反向翻译确保语言质量

Result: 创建了首个公开的拉丁语谨怀分析咄多选题答题数据集，并证明这些合成数据能夯显著提升意大利语-拉丁语翻译的性能

Conclusion: 为缘危语言拉丁语提供了重要的NLP资源，为其他低资源语言的语料构建提供了可行方法

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TKGQA方法主要关注隐式时序约束，缺乏处理复杂时序查询的能力，且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播问题

Method: RTQA包含三个核心组件：时序问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器，采用递归思维将问题分解为子问题，利用LLMs和TKG知识自底向上求解，并通过多路径聚合提高容错性

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，RTQA在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别上实现了显著的Hits@1提升，优于最先进方法

Conclusion: RTQA框架有效解决了复杂时序查询处理问题，通过递归分解和聚合机制提升了TKGQA的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在基准测试中的表现对输入措辞变化敏感，虽然模型排名相对稳定，但绝对性能会显著下降，表明当前基准测试不能充分反映模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在真实应用中的表现，因为现实世界存在语言变异性，需要模型能够处理同一问题的不同表述方式，而现有基准测试使用固定标准化格式，可能无法准确反映模型的实际能力。

Method: 系统生成六个常见基准测试中所有问题的多种释义版本，测试34个不同规模和性能的最先进大型语言模型在这些释义输入下的效果变化。

Result: LLM在释义输入下的排名相对稳定，但绝对效果分数发生变化且显著下降，表明模型对语言变异性处理能力不足。

Conclusion: 当前基于基准测试的评估方法可靠性存疑，高分不一定代表模型对真实输入变化的鲁棒性，需要开发更能反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Method: 使用κ_p相似性度量方法，在GlobalMMLU数据集上分析20种语言和47个主题的模型输出。

Result: 模型规模和能力增长时，跨语言输出一致性显著提高；模型自身跨语言一致性高于不同模型间的一致性。

Conclusion: κ_p是评估多语言可靠性的实用工具，可指导开发更一致的多语言系统。

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Motivation: 系统功能语法及其分支卡迪夫语法已在多语言文本分析中广泛应用，但中文文本缺乏基于该理论的自动标注系统，限制了相关理论的应用和推广。

Method: 从人民日报2014语料中随机选取4100个句子进行功能句法标注建立数据集，基于该数据集对RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext模型进行微调，实现命名实体识别任务。

Result: 在测试集上F1分数达到0.852，显著优于其他对比模型，在识别主语(S)、主要动词(M)、补语(C)等核心句法成分方面表现优异，但在标签样本不均衡的实体识别方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 作为首次将功能句法与基于注意力的NLP模型相结合的研究，为中文功能句法自动分析提供了新方法，为后续研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了隐蔽叙事检测和解释生成的挑战，通过知识增强提高了系统性能。

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Motivation: 虽然词汇对齐能够提升沟通效果，但在大语言模型新进展的背景下，对话机器人中的词汇对齐实现仍然研究不涵。需要构建稳定的个性化词汇模型作为基础。

Method: 通过变化语料量和不同词性类别的项目数量，使用回归率、覆盖率和余弦相似性指标来评估模型性能。

Result: 小规模紧凑的模型表现最佳：10分钟语料，形容词和连词各4项，副词、名词、代词和动词各10项。

Conclusion: 研究提供了构建稳定个性化词汇模型的实践见解，考虑了最小数据需求，为对话机器人的词汇对齐策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索了联合建模实体和篇章关系的方法，实验表明整合这两种特征能显著提升连贯性评估模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连贯性建模研究大多单独关注实体特征或篇章关系特征，很少将两者结合，需要探索联合建模的方法。

Method: 提出了两种联合建模实体和篇章关系的方法，在三个基准数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，整合实体和篇章关系特征显著提升了连贯性模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和篇章关系对于连贯性评估具有重要价值，联合建模方法能有效提升模型效果。

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

TL;DR: MAGneT是一个新颖的多智能体框架，用于生成合成心理咨询会话，通过分解咨询师响应生成任务到专门的心理技术智能体，显著提升了生成会话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展心理咨询需求的增长，需要高质量、隐私合规的数据来微调开源大语言模型，但此类数据稀缺。现有单智能体方法难以捕捉真实咨询的结构和细微差别。

Method: 提出MAGneT多智能体框架，将咨询师响应生成分解为由专门LLM智能体处理的协调子任务，每个智能体模拟关键心理技术。同时提出统一的评估框架，整合多种自动和专家指标，将专家评估从4个方面扩展到9个方面。

Result: MAGneT在生成会话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐性方面显著优于现有方法，平均提升一般咨询技能3.2%和CBT特定技能4.3%。专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT生成的会话。使用MAGneT生成会话微调的模型性能更好，平均提升6.3%的一般咨询技能和7.3%的CBT特定技能。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架有效解决了高质量心理咨询数据稀缺问题，通过多智能体方法更好地模拟真实咨询过程，为心理咨询领域的LLM微调提供了高质量合成数据，并建立了更全面的评估标准。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但标注成本高且劳动密集，需要解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出SED-Aug双重增强框架：1）显式文本增强使用大语言模型通过5种生成策略增强文本信息；2）隐式特征增强设计5种新颖的扰动技术在特征空间操作结构融合嵌入，保持语义和关系属性。

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提高约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提高约15.57%。

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架有效解决了社交媒体事件检测中的数据稀缺问题，通过双重增强策略显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在监督微调后往往表现出认知惯性，难以遵循与标准化模式相冲突的指令，需要评估这种局限性

Method: 构建包含8类挑战的基准数据集（1012个中英文问题），使用人类参与流程创建高质量数据，采用优化的LLM-as-a-Judge评估框架

Result: 实验表明现有领先LLMs存在认知惯性问题，验证了Inverse IFEval基准的必要性

Conclusion: 未来的对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实正确性，还应考虑非传统情境下的适应性，该基准可作为诊断工具和开发方法的基础

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查大语言模型在医疗领域使用时的风险，特别是当医学建议随着新研究而发展时，模型可能因依赖静态训练数据而提供过时或有害的建议。

Method: 创建了两个新的问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个问答对，涵盖普通生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个问答对，涵盖医学共识发生变化的内容），并对八个主流大语言模型进行评估。

Result: 所有模型都一致地依赖过时知识，并分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略对这种现象的影响。

Conclusion: 论文为开发更新、更可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础，并提出了减缓这一问题的未来研究方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，即使微小的提示词变化也能显著改变偏见测量结果，有时甚至完全反转偏见方向


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响场景中的广泛应用，性别偏见问题日益受到关注，但现有评估方法往往使用与自然语言分布不同的任务提示，可能影响测量结果的有效性

Method: 通过测试不同提示条件（使测试情境突出和使性别相关内容突出），在四种任务格式中使用token概率和离散选择指标评估模型敏感性

Result: 即使微小的提示变化也能显著改变偏见结果，有时完全反转方向；离散选择指标倾向于放大偏见；揭示了LLM评估的脆弱性

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅凸显了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，还为NLP基准测试提出了新问题：受控测试设计在多大程度上会触发LLM的"测试模式"性能，这对未来基准测试的生态有效性意味着什么

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

Motivation: 虽然之前的研究分析和改善了语言模型的时间推理能力，但大多数研究仅聚焦于公历，而许多非公历系统如日本历、希吉来历和希伯来历等仍在活跃使用且体现了文化根基的时间概念。当前语言模型是否以及如何准确处理这些非公历系统尚未评估。

Method: 创建了四个需要时间知识和时间推理的任务数据集，系统评估了一系列英语中心和日语中心的开放源语言模型在日本历法处理方面的表现。

Result: 发现某些模型能够进行历法转换，但即使是日语中心模型也在日本历法的数学运算以及在不同历法之间保持一致性方面遇到困难。

Conclusion: 结果强调了开发更好处理文化特定历法理解的语言模型的重要性。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

TL;DR: SwinSRGAN是一个端到端的语音超分辨率框架，使用Swin Transformer U-Net结构，通过混合对抗训练方案在MDCT域实现实时48kHz上采样，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音超分辨率系统存在表示不匹配、CNN生成器过度平滑高频内容、扩散模型计算成本高且跨域鲁棒性有限等问题。

Method: 基于Swin Transformer的U-Net架构，在MDCT幅度域操作，采用混合对抗训练方案（时域MPD/MSD判别器+多频带MDCT判别器），使用稀疏感知正则化器处理arcsinh压缩的MDCT。

Result: 在标准基准测试中减少了客观误差并提高了ABX偏好分数，在HiFi-TTS零样本测试中无需微调即优于NVSR和mdctGAN，展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: SwinSRGAN提供了一个高效、实时的语音超分辨率解决方案，能够处理不同采样率输入并实现单次48kHz上采样，在性能和泛化能力方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SR) reconstructs high-frequency content from
low-resolution speech signals. Existing systems often suffer from
representation mismatch in two-stage mel-vocoder pipelines and from
over-smoothing of hallucinated high-band content by CNN-only generators.
Diffusion and flow models are computationally expensive, and their robustness
across domains and sampling rates remains limited. We propose SwinSRGAN, an
end-to-end framework operating on Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT)
magnitudes. It is a Swin Transformer-based U-Net that captures long-range
spectro-temporal dependencies with a hybrid adversarial scheme combines
time-domain MPD/MSD discriminators with a multi-band MDCT discriminator
specialized for the high-frequency band. We employs a sparse-aware regularizer
on arcsinh-compressed MDCT to better preserve transient components. The system
upsamples inputs at various sampling rates to 48 kHz in a single pass and
operates in real time. On standard benchmarks, SwinSRGAN reduces objective
error and improves ABX preference scores. In zero-shot tests on HiFi-TTS
without fine-tuning, it outperforms NVSR and mdctGAN, demonstrating strong
generalization across datasets

Motivation: 当前通用音乐表示模型难以捕捉独奏钢琴音乐的细微语义差异，且现有钢琴专用模型多为单模态，无法充分利用钢琴音乐的多模态特性（音频、符号、文本）。

Method: 提出PianoBind钢琴专用多模态联合嵌入模型，系统研究多源训练策略和模态利用方法，针对小规模和同质钢琴数据集进行优化设计。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅解决了钢琴音乐表示的特殊挑战，其设计选择也为其他同质数据集的多模态表示学习提供了可复用的见解。

Abstract: Solo piano music, despite being a single-instrument medium, possesses
significant expressive capabilities, conveying rich semantic information across
genres, moods, and styles. However, current general-purpose music
representation models, predominantly trained on large-scale datasets, often
struggle to captures subtle semantic distinctions within homogeneous solo piano
music. Furthermore, existing piano-specific representation models are typically
unimodal, failing to capture the inherently multimodal nature of piano music,
expressed through audio, symbolic, and textual modalities. To address these
limitations, we propose PianoBind, a piano-specific multimodal joint embedding
model. We systematically investigate strategies for multi-source training and
modality utilization within a joint embedding framework optimized for capturing
fine-grained semantic distinctions in (1) small-scale and (2) homogeneous piano
datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that PianoBind learns multimodal
representations that effectively capture subtle nuances of piano music,
achieving superior text-to-music retrieval performance on in-domain and
out-of-domain piano datasets compared to general-purpose music joint embedding
models. Moreover, our design choices offer reusable insights for multimodal
representation learning with homogeneous datasets beyond piano music.

Abstract: The development of speech understanding and generation has been significantly
accelerated by the availability of large-scale, high-quality speech datasets.
Among these, ASR and TTS are regarded as the most established and fundamental
tasks. However, for Cantonese (Yue Chinese), spoken by approximately 84.9
million native speakers worldwide, limited annotated resources have hindered
progress and resulted in suboptimal ASR and TTS performance. To address this
challenge, we propose WenetSpeech-Pipe, an integrated pipeline for building
large-scale speech corpus with multi-dimensional annotation tailored for speech
understanding and generation. It comprises six modules: Audio Collection,
Speaker Attributes Annotation, Speech Quality Annotation, Automatic Speech
Recognition, Text Postprocessing and Recognizer Output Voting, enabling rich
and high-quality annotations. Based on this pipeline, we release
WenetSpeech-Yue, the first large-scale Cantonese speech corpus with
multi-dimensional annotation for ASR and TTS, covering 21,800 hours across 10
domains with annotations including ASR transcription, text confidence, speaker
identity, age, gender, speech quality scores, among other annotations. We also
release WSYue-eval, a comprehensive Cantonese benchmark with two components:
WSYue-ASR-eval, a manually annotated set for evaluating ASR on short and long
utterances, code-switching, and diverse acoustic conditions, and
WSYue-TTS-eval, with base and coverage subsets for standard and generalization
testing. Experimental results show that models trained on WenetSpeech-Yue
achieve competitive results against state-of-the-art (SOTA) Cantonese ASR and
TTS systems, including commercial and LLM-based models, highlighting the value
of our dataset and pipeline.

Abstract: Full-duplex, spontaneous conversational data are essential for enhancing the
naturalness and interactivity of synthesized speech in conversational TTS
systems. We present two open-source dual-track conversational speech datasets,
one in Chinese and one in English, designed to enhance the naturalness of
synthesized speech by providing more realistic conversational data. The two
datasets contain a total of 15 hours of natural, spontaneous conversations
recorded in isolated rooms, which produces separate high-quality audio tracks
for each speaker. The conversations cover diverse daily topics and domains,
capturing realistic interaction patterns including frequent overlaps,
backchannel responses, laughter, and other non-verbal vocalizations. We
introduce the data collection procedure, transcription and annotation methods.
We demonstrate the utility of these corpora by fine-tuning a baseline TTS model
with the proposed datasets. The fine-tuned TTS model achieves higher subjective
and objective evaluation metrics compared to the baseline, indicating improved
naturalness and conversational realism in synthetic speech. All data,
annotations, and supporting code for fine-tuning and evaluation are made
available to facilitate further research in conversational speech synthesis.

Abstract: With the continuous development of speech recognition technology, speaker
verification (SV) has become an important method for identity authentication.
Traditional SV methods rely on handcrafted feature extraction, while deep
learning has significantly improved system performance. However, the scarcity
of labeled data still limits the widespread application of deep learning in SV.
Self-supervised learning, by mining latent information in large unlabeled
datasets, enhances model generalization and is a key technology to address this
issue.
  DINO is an efficient self-supervised learning method that generates
pseudo-labels from unlabeled speech data through clustering, supporting
subsequent training. However, clustering may produce noisy pseudo-labels, which
can reduce overall recognition performance.
  To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved clustering framework
based on similarity connection graphs and Graph Convolutional Networks. By
leveraging GCNs' ability to model structured data and incorporating relational
information between nodes in the similarity connection graph, the clustering
process is optimized, improving pseudo-label accuracy and enhancing the
robustness and performance of the self-supervised speaker verification system.
Experimental results show that this method significantly improves system
performance and provides a new approach for self-supervised speaker
verification.

Conclusion: 该方法通过系统化的两阶段学习策略，有效提升了音频深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和跨域适应能力，为对抗域偏置提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) models have made significant
progress in audio deepfake detection (ADD) tasks. However, existing SSL models
mainly rely on large-scale real speech for pre-training and lack the learning
of spoofed samples, which leads to susceptibility to domain bias during the
fine-tuning process of the ADD task. To this end, we propose a two-stage
learning strategy (Wav2DF-TSL) based on pre-training and hierarchical expert
fusion for robust audio deepfake detection. In the pre-training stage, we use
adapters to efficiently learn artifacts from 3000 hours of unlabelled spoofed
speech, improving the adaptability of front-end features while mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose the hierarchical
adaptive mixture of experts (HA-MoE) method to dynamically fuse multi-level
spoofing cues through multi-expert collaboration with gated routing.
Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms
the baseline system on all four benchmark datasets, especially on the
cross-domain In-the-wild dataset, achieving a 27.5% relative improvement in
equal error rate (EER), outperforming the existing state-of-the-art systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音生成系统能产生难以区分真伪的语音，但现有检测方法在真实环境中效果不佳，主要原因是训练和测试样本之间的领域偏移问题，现有数据集缺乏真实世界应用的挑战性。

Method: 构建AUDETER数据集，包含大量由多种TTS模型和声码器生成的合成音频，通过在该数据集上训练和测试现有SOTA方法，评估其泛化性能。

Result: 实验表明：1）在现有数据集上训练的SOTA方法对新深度伪造音频样本泛化能力差，对未见人类语音误报率高；2）在AUDETER上训练的方法泛化性能显著提升，检测错误率降低44.1%-51.6%，在In-the-Wild数据集上错误率仅为4.17%。

Conclusion: AUDETER数据集能够有效训练通用的深度伪造音频检测器，显著提升检测性能，为开发鲁棒的深度伪造检测系统提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Speech generation systems can produce remarkably realistic vocalisations that
are often indistinguishable from human speech, posing significant authenticity
challenges. Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed,
their effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the
domain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human
speech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately
addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges
with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To
fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale,
highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust
development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of
over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10
vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio
clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive
experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio
samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice,
underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods
trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and
significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error
rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild
dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.
AUDETER is available on GitHub.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂嘈杂环境中进行语音识别后处理时适应性差、信息利用率低的问题

Method: 噪声自适应声学编码器、异构特征补偿动态融合(HFCDF)机制、强化学习训练策略

Result: 在嘈杂环境中显著提高了准确性和鲁棒性，在未见噪声场景中表现出良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: Denoising GER框架有效解决了嘈杂环境下语音识别后处理的挑战，提升了模型的适应性和多模态信息利用率

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLM) have made significant progress
in the task of generation error correction (GER) for automatic speech
recognition (ASR) post-processing. However, in complex noisy environments, they
still face challenges such as poor adaptability and low information
utilization, resulting in limited effectiveness of GER. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a noise-robust multi-modal GER framework (Denoising
GER). The framework enhances the model's adaptability to different noisy
scenarios through a noise-adaptive acoustic encoder and optimizes the
integration of multi-modal information via a heterogeneous feature compensation
dynamic fusion (HFCDF) mechanism, improving the LLM's utilization of
multi-modal information. Additionally, reinforcement learning (RL) training
strategies are introduced to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that Denoising GER significantly improves
accuracy and robustness in noisy environments and exhibits good generalization
abilities in unseen noise scenarios.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为上下文化分识判别(CTD)的新方法，用于改善语音搜索查询的拼写纠正效果。方法利用BERT生成上下文化表征，通过比较原始和上下文化表征来纠正错误的查询词汇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语音搜索的普及，自动语音识别(ASR)系统产生的误识别转写需要有效的纠正方法来帮助用户更准确地表达搜索意图。

Method: 首先使用BERT生成词汇级别的上下文化表征，然后构建组合层来增强语义信息，最后通过比较原始和上下文化表征来纠正错误词汇并生成正确查询。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在所有指标上都表现優异，还提供了包含ASR转写错误的新基准数据集以进行全面评估。

Conclusion: CTD方法能够有效地纠正语音查询中的拼写错误，为音频查询纠正领域提供了一个综合性的评估框架。

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.
