We show that this interaction hides a\ncritical safety gap: if harmful content is embedded in a video, either as\nfull-frame inserts or as small corner patches, state-of-the-art VideoLLMs\nrarely mention the harmful content in the output, despite its clear visibility\nto human viewers. A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws:\n(1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced\nframe sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss\nintroduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3)\nencoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized\nduring text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query\nblack-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our\nlarge-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness\nomission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly\npresent in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it.

We devise a\nspecialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning\nproblem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for\nrelevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes\nenvironmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages.

Adaptation\nto prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and\ncitizenship modification.\n  Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained\nbias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios\nand topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e14\u4e0e\u4e3b\u9898\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u4e0e\u6781\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u67d0\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u4ecd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u654f\u611f\u8bdd\u9898\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6781\u5316\u654f\u611f\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af-\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u6218\u4e89\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u666e\u904d\u5bf9\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u6301\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6781\u5316\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u8865\u3002"}}

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs)\nto generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns\nacross large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to\ncapture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their\ndiagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of\npersonalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors\nbased on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past\nquestion-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that\neffectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task\nis challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which\noften lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based\ngroup-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free\ntwo-stage framework.

In the second\nstage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new\nquestions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with\nthe student's recurring misconceptions.

By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the\nglobal Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier\nTransform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits\nsignificantly higher spectral energy.

Based on this key insight, we\nconstruct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the\nglobal DFT: DFT total energy.

For IR, we employ a\ncontrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by\ncross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly\noptimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion\nstrategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by\nanalyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization,\nproving more effective than traditional Model Soups.

We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation.
