However, most datasets for multimodal MIR neglect\nthis aspect and provide data at the level of individual music tracks. We aim to\nfill this gap by providing Music4All Artist and Album (Music4All A+A), a\ndataset for multimodal MIR tasks based on music artists and albums. Music4All\nA+A is built on top of the Music4All-Onion dataset, an existing track-level\ndataset for MIR tasks. Music4All A+A provides metadata, genre labels, image\nrepresentations, and textual descriptors for 6,741 artists and 19,511 albums.\nFurthermore, since Music4All A+A is built on top of Music4All-Onion, it allows\naccess to other multimodal data at the track level, including user--item\ninteraction data. This renders Music4All A+A suitable for a broad range of MIR\ntasks, including multimodal music recommendation, at several levels of\ngranularity. To showcase the use of Music4All A+A, we carry out experiments on\nmultimodal genre classification of artists and albums, including an analysis in\nmissing-modality scenarios, and a quantitative comparison with genre\nclassification in the movie domain.

However, most datasets for multimodal MIR neglect\nthis aspect and provide data at the level of individual music tracks. We aim to\nfill this gap by providing Music4All Artist and Album (Music4All A+A), a\ndataset for multimodal MIR tasks based on music artists and albums.

FURINA eliminates the\nrouter by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three\ncore innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for\nLoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent\nactivation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent\nexpert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity\nbetween the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts,\nwhich are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector. This design allows the\noutput norm to naturally reflect the importance of each expert, thereby\nenabling dynamic, router-free routing. The expert selection loss further\nsharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard\nMoE activation patterns. We also introduce a shared expert within the MoE-LoRA\nblock that provides stable, foundational knowledge. To the best of our\nknowledge, FURINA is the first router-free, MoE-enhanced LoRA method that can\nbe fully merged into the backbone model, introducing zero additional\ninference-time cost or complexity.

Experiments\non three benchmark tasks -- HateXplain, Latent Hate, and Implicit Hate --\ndemonstrate that SMARTER enables LLMs to achieve up to a 13.5% macro-F1\nimprovement over standard few-shot baselines while using only a fraction of the\nfull training data. Our framework offers a scalable strategy for low-resource\nsettings by harnessing LLMs' self-improving capabilities for both\nclassification and explanation."}

Diffusion-based language models offer a promising\nalternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we\nidentify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window\nproblem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become\nirrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address\nthis issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and\nbidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To\novercome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based\nmethod that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to\nbetter fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based\nFine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at\npositions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on\nopen-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM\nbaselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works,\ndemonstrating both speed and quality improvements."}

Approaches such as GPTQ\neffectively minimize input-weight product errors during quantization; however,\nrecent empirical studies show that they can increase biased outputs and degrade\nperformance on fairness benchmarks, and it remains unclear which specific\nweights cause this issue. In this work, we draw new links between quantization\nand model fairness by adding explicit group-fairness constraints to the\nquantization objective and introduce Fair-GPTQ, the first quantization method\nexplicitly designed to reduce unfairness in large language models. The added\nconstraints guide the learning of the rounding operation toward less-biased\ntext generation for protected groups. Specifically, we focus on stereotype\ngeneration involving occupational bias and discriminatory language spanning\ngender, race, and religion. Fair-GPTQ has minimal impact on performance,\npreserving at least 90% of baseline accuracy on zero-shot benchmarks, reduces\nunfairness relative to a half-precision model, and retains the memory and speed\nbenefits of 4-bit quantization. We also compare the performance of Fair-GPTQ\nwith existing debiasing methods and find that it achieves performance on par\nwith the iterative null-space projection debiasing approach on\nracial-stereotype benchmarks. Overall, the results validate our theoretical\nsolution to the quantization problem with a group-bias term, highlight its\napplicability for reducing group bias at quantization time in generative\nmodels, and demonstrate that our approach can further be used to analyze\nchannel- and weight-level contributions to fairness during quantization."}

A Comparative Study of Multimodal, Caption-Based, and Hybrid Retrieval Techniques", "comment": null, "summary": "Slide decks, serving as digital reports that bridge the gap between\npresentation slides and written documents, are a prevalent medium for conveying\ninformation in both academic and corporate settings. Their multimodal nature,\ncombining text, images, and charts, presents challenges for retrieval-augmented\ngeneration systems, where the quality of retrieval directly impacts downstream\nperformance. Traditional approaches to slide retrieval often involve separate\nindexing of modalities, which can increase complexity and lose contextual\ninformation. This paper investigates various methodologies for effective slide\nretrieval, including visual late-interaction embedding models like ColPali, the\nuse of visual rerankers, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine dense\nretrieval with BM25, further enhanced by textual rerankers and fusion methods\nlike Reciprocal Rank Fusion. A novel Vision-Language Models-based captioning\npipeline is also evaluated, demonstrating significantly reduced embedding\nstorage requirements compared to visual late-interaction techniques, alongside\ncomparable retrieval performance. Our analysis extends to the practical aspects\nof these methods, evaluating their runtime performance and storage demands\nalongside retrieval efficacy, thus offering practical guidance for the\nselection and development of efficient and robust slide retrieval systems for\nreal-world applications."}

We introduce a novel framework for\noppression measurement that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate\ncontext-sensitive scores of lived historical disadvantage across diverse\ngeopolitical settings. Using unstructured self-identified ethnicity utterances\nfrom a multilingual COVID-19 global study, we design rule-guided prompting\nstrategies that encourage models to produce interpretable, theoretically\ngrounded estimations of oppression. We systematically evaluate these strategies\nacross multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when\nguided by explicit rules, can capture nuanced forms of identity-based\nhistorical oppression within nations. This approach provides a complementary\nmeasurement tool that highlights dimensions of systemic exclusion, offering a\nscalable, cross-cultural lens for understanding how oppression manifests in\ndata-driven research and public health contexts.

Instead of constructing\ncontamination-free datasets (quite hard), we propose a novel framework,\n\\textbf{LNE-Blocking}, to restore model performance prior to contamination on\npotentially leaked datasets. Our framework consists of two components:\ncontamination detection and disruption operation. For the prompt, the framework\nfirst uses the contamination detection method, \\textbf{LNE}, to assess the\nextent of contamination in the model. Based on this, it adjusts the intensity\nof the disruption operation, \\textbf{Blocking}, to elicit non-memorized\nresponses from the model. Our framework is the first to efficiently restore the\nmodel's greedy decoding performance.
